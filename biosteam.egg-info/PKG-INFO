        What is BioSTEAM?
        -----------------
        
        BioSTEAM is an open source process simulation package in Python for fast and flexible techno-economic analysis. BioSTEAM objects serve as basic building blocks to design and simulate a biorefinery. These include objects that handle material properties, material flows, unit operations, recycle loops and process specifications.
